## Configuration

### Required Secrets

The monitoring system uses the following GitHub secrets:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided, used for API access
- `DISPATCH_TOKEN`: Optional, for enhanced repository dispatch permissions

### Workflow Permissions

The monitoring workflow requires these permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read      # Read repository contents
  issues: write       # Create and manage issues
  actions: read       # Read workflow run information
  packages: read      # Read container registry information
```

### Customization Options

You can customize the monitoring behavior by modifying `.github/workflows/monitoring.yml`:

**Notification Frequency**:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: "0 */6 * * *"  # Change to adjust Aurora check frequency
```

**Issue Auto-Assignment**:
```yaml
--assignee "${{ github.repository_owner }}"  # Change to assign to different user
```

**Cleanup Timing**:
```yaml
# Adjust age thresholds for issue cleanup
select((.createdAt | fromdateiso8601) < (now - 604800))  # 7 days for build failures
select((.createdAt | fromdateiso8601) < (now - 259200))  # 3 days for Aurora updates
```

## Integration with External Services

### Slack/Discord Notifications

To integrate with external notification services, you can extend the monitoring workflow:

```yaml
- name: Send Slack notification
  if: github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'failure'
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: failure
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

### Email Notifications

GitHub automatically sends email notifications for:
- Issues assigned to you
- Repository watch notifications
- Workflow failure notifications (if enabled in settings)

### Custom Webhooks

You can add custom webhook notifications by extending the monitoring workflow with HTTP requests to your preferred services.

## Metrics and Analytics

The monitoring system tracks several key metrics:

### Build Metrics
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful builds in the last 10 runs
- **Build Frequency**: How often builds are triggered
- **Build Duration**: Time taken for each build (available in workflow logs)
- **Failure Patterns**: Common causes of build failures

### Aurora Update Metrics
- **Update Frequency**: How often Aurora base image updates
- **Kernel Version Changes**: Tracking kernel version progression
- **Update Response Time**: Time between Aurora update and our build

### Package Metrics
